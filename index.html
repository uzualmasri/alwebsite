              Al-Nihaya Holdings Completes Strategic Integration of Dar Al-Mizan
            </h1>
            <span class="date">21 November 2022</span>
            <p>
              Al-Nihaya Holdings today announced the completion of its strategic
              integration of Dar Al-Mizan, marking a significant step in the
              Group’s ongoing efforts to consolidate its infrastructure and
              construction capabilities across the Gulf region.
            </p>
            <p>
              The integration brings together complementary operational
              strengths, project portfolios, and technical expertise,
              reinforcing Al-Nihaya Holdings’ long-term objective of delivering
              coordinated, large-scale infrastructure projects under a unified
              governance framework. The process was designed to ensure minimal
              disruption to ongoing projects while aligning legacy operations
              with the Group’s broader strategic direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              The integration was architected and executed under the direction
              of Khalid Al-Rashid, who led the valuation realignment, governance
              restructuring, and development of the post-integration operating
              model. This included the standardisation of decision-making
              processes, consolidation of reporting structures, and the
              establishment of centralised oversight mechanisms intended to
              support consistency and accountability across active and future
              projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commenting on the integration, Al-Rashid noted that the
              transaction required “clear authority and difficult decisions to
              ensure long-term organisational stability,” adding that the focus
              throughout the process remained on safeguarding project continuity
              and protecting stakeholder interests during a period of structural
              transition.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of the integration, Dar Al-Mizan’s former executive
              leadership stepped back from operational control, reflecting the
              shift to a centralised management model. Select members of the
              legacy leadership were retained in advisory capacities to support
              knowledge transfer, provide historical project context, and assist
              in maintaining continuity across existing contractual obligations
              during the transition phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Al-Nihaya Holdings emphasised that this approach aligns with its
              philosophy of disciplined consolidation, where legacy expertise is
              preserved where it remains operationally relevant, while strategic
              control and governance are exercised at the Group level. The
              integration is expected to enhance coordination across project
              teams, streamline resource allocation, and strengthen the Group’s
              ability to manage complex infrastructure programmes over extended
              delivery timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Group reiterated its commitment to maintaining stability
              across all ongoing projects and to working closely with partners,
              clients, and stakeholders as the integrated organisation moves
              forward under its consolidated operating structure.
